- number of connected clients
- chat
- total number of pixels placed
- bursts (3 sec slots of unlimited pixels placings). The more pixels you've placed, the longer the burst lasts.
    - maybe something like "burst panel", "current burst" with progress bar to the next one.
    - min burst 2 sec. max burst 10 sec.
    - pixels placed during the burst don't count in the achievement score.

- patterns (unlock after achieving a certain number of pixels)
    - could achieve only after the max burst??
    
- pattern of the day (collaborative) - everyone who participated receives an achievment.
    - need to have achivement badges,
        like a "TEAM PLAYER" - completed a pattern of the day (not solo)
        "SOLO WARRIOR" - completed a pattern of the day solo (in burst? possible?)
        "BURST KING" - completed a pattern in a single burst


there are only two visilble HTML elements - colors picker and header with menu (chat / settings / etc)
