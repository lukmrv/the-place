Ideas brainstorming:
- number of connected clients
- chat
- total number of pixels placed
- bursts (3 sec slots of unlimited pixels placings). The more pixels you've placed, the longer the burst lasts.
    - maybe something like "burst panel", "current burst" with progress bar to the next one.
    - min burst 2 sec. max burst 10 sec.
    - pixels placed during the burst don't count in the achievement score.
- pattern of the day (collaborative) - everyone who participated receives an achievment.
    - need to have achivement badges,
        like a "TEAM PLAYER" - completed a pattern of the day (not solo)
        "SOLO WARRIOR" - completed a pattern of the day solo (in burst? possible?)
        "BURST CRUISER" - placed more than 100 pixel in total in burst mode
        "PRO BURSTer" - placed more than 20 pixels in a burst
        "BURST KING" - completed a pattern in a single burst


Stats for:

placed pixels
- total
- user placed vs total placed


there are only two visilble HTML elements - colors picker and header with menu (chat / settings / etc)


MVP:
Progression is based on challenges:

first challenge set 2 pixels from a pool
    reward: alphabet
second challenge set 3 pixels from a pool
    reward: defined patterns
third challenge set 5 pixels from a pool
    reward: pattern creation


Grid loading animation:
- white pixels
- 1% of pixels are updated with random colors
- repeat

Different colors palettes  for each day.
